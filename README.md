# Titanic-survival-rate-Data-Wrangling-Visualization-and-Feature-Engineering

I would like to use one of the Kaggle's competition's, to go through the step by step workflow of solving a problem with machine learning techiniques. I studied the code from Manav Sehgal and would like to document my learnings and findings. 

Project Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, I would like to make the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.


Steps taken:

1) Get the training and testing data sets

2) Meet and Greet the data :
 
   - Identify the data types: numerical, ordinal, categorical, mixed types
   - Identify missing data columns, possible data errors , empty columns etc
   - get a feel on the basic statistics information of the data columns. 

3) Data Analysis using pivoting features 

   -  analysis the data by pivoting some features
   - make some initial assumptions based on the findings: e.g. gender, age, Pclass has strong         correlations with survival rate 

4) Data Analysis using visualization 

  - further confirm and test some assumptions based on visualization 
  - use Seaborn, Matplotlib to visualize the correlation between features 
 -  Decisions made in regards to how to further engineer the features

5) Feature engineering

 - Dropped features
-  new feature created based on existing ones
-  features converted into categorical features

6) Machine Learning 

  
7) Model tuning
